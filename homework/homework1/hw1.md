# Homework 1 Tasks:

## Task 1

Email a link of your github page to Dr. Koebbe.

Emailed:
https://github.com/nicoleefleming 

## Task 2

Create math5620 repository and add Dr. Koebbe as a collaborator. 

Emailed:
https://github.com/nicoleefleming/math5620

## Task 3

State which command-line interface you will be using for this course.

I will be using the Bash shell as my commandline utility.

## Task 4

Write code that can be run by Dr. Koebbe using the commandline in the language that will be used by me this semester.

Here is a link to my code:
main.java:
https://github.com/nicoleefleming/math5620/tree/master/homework/homework1/5620HW1/src
If the entire folder is desired, the folder 5620hw1 is the folder to pull down. 


## Task 5

Provide, email a link to Dr. Koebbe to the table of contents that will be used for this course.

Emailed:
https://github.com/nicoleefleming/math5620/blob/master/README.md  

## Task 6
Search the internet for sites that discuss difference quotient approximations of derivatives and applications
where these approximations are used.
Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings, Include links to the sites you use.

### Response

Based on my findings, the difference quotient is used to estimate slopes of a line. The approximations allow for 
slopes in partial derivatives to be taken. Some of the applications of this difference quotient approximation can be
used to calculate the velocity gradient for blood flow. This quotient is very useful for clustered points to 
get a close approximation to the slope of the line, or the gradient of a vector.
