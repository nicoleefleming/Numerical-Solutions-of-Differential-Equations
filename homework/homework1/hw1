## Task 6
Search the internet for sites that discuss difference quotient approximations of derivatives and applications
where these approximations are used.
Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings, Include links to the sites you use.

# Response

Based on my findings, the difference quotient is used to estimate slopes of a line. The approximations allow for 
slopes in partial derivatives to be taken. Some of the applications of this difference quotient approximation can be
used to calculate the velocity gradient for blood flow. This quotient is very useful for clustered points to 
get a close approximation to the slope of the line, or the gradient of a vector.
