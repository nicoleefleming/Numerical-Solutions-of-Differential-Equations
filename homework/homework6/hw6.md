## Task 1
Task 1: Write a code that solves the Poisson equation where the linear solver used is Gauss-Seidel. So, use the equation
Δu = ∂2u/∂x2 + ∂2u/∂y2 = f(x,y) with f(x,y) = xy       
and homogeneous boundary conditions.

## Task 2
Write a code to solve a linear system of equations using the conjugate gradient method. For a test case, use the matrix for the Poisson equation. Use the methodology discussed in class to test the method. That is, generate a right hand side from a vector of ones in the specification of the linear system.

## Task 3
Solve Δu =∂2u/∂x2 +∂2u/∂y2 = f(x,y) with f(x,y) = xy and homogeneous boundary conditions. Use at least three different mesh sizes, say h = 0.1, h = 0.01, and h = 0.001 for the test.

## Task 5
Build a code using previously created codes that will compute an approximate solution for the Poisson equation using a 9 point stencil for the Poisson equation in Task 1.

### Response



## Task 6
Search the internet for articles that compare 5 point stencil finite difference approximations and 9 point stencil finite difference approximations. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describes your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
